The remaining lessons will be conducted in Quantopian's Interactive Development Environment (IDE) where we will build a trading algorithm, attach our data pipeline to it, and use alpha scores for portfolio construction. Then, we will analyze our algorithm's performance under more realistic conditions by simulating it over historical data. This type of historical simulation is commonly known as \"backtesting.\""

Any variables that we want to persist between function calls should be stored in `context` instead of using global variables. Context variables can be accessed and initialized using dot notation (`context.some_attribute`).\n",

For example, we can schedule a function to rebalance our portfolio at market open on the first day of each week as follows:"
